# Update Emacs Lisp code to use cl-lib instead of cl

`cl` is a deprecated library, and elisp authors should use `cl-lib`
instead.  In most cases, this is a matter of requiring "cl-lib" and
adding a "cl-" prefix to symbols that came from "cl".

This library provides an interactive command, `cl-libify`, which
replaces usages of "cl" symbols with their "cl-lib" equivalent,
optionally prompting for each

Note that some cl functions do not have exact replacements,
e.g. `flet`, so further code changes might still be necessary.

You can also use `cl-libify-mark-cl-symbols-obsolete` to mark old `cl`
names as obsolete, so that the byte compiler will help flag their use.

## Installation

### Manual

Ensure `cl-libify.el` is in a directory on your load-path, and
add the following to your `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

``` lisp
(require 'cl-libify)
```

### MELPA

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of
`package.el` you can install `cl-libify` from the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) repository. The version of
`cl-libify` there will always be up-to-date.

See the command `cl-libify`.
